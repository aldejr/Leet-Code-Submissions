# Leet-Code-Submissions
I am using this repo to track my progress on leetcode. The goal is to hold myself accountable to persistent practice by documenting the work here.

Goals for 2025 - 2026:
  100 Easy Problems, Progress: 19/100 |
  50 Medium Problems, Progress: 0/50 |
  25 Hard Problems, Progress: 0/25
